# WIP (priority)

	TODO: volume too loud? mute button? :/

	TODO: build.bat -> build (posix shell) -- ( you currently need Linux/WSL anyway )

	TODO: replace swc with esbuild (swc keeps randomly corrupting output)

	TODO: mobile: virtual joystick

	TODO: rethink network architecture so server is authoritative and checks commands for sanity
		-- for each command, think of all the ways it can be abused, and how to detect / prevent that.
	
	TODO: Feedback when hit other player (currently only when you are hit)

	TODO: CHAT: move chat in-game (eliminate HTML elements)

	TODO: CANVAS: auto-resize

	TODO: CANVAS: scale in CSS?

	TODO: Random spawn pos
	
	TODO: make it so you can't go outside the screen
	
	TODO: make world bigger
	
	MAYBE: add camera
	


# META


# BUGS

	TODO: respawn can fail if afk ? (need a better respawn system anyway)




# HACKING

	TODO: update bullet spawn command so it uses relative index not absolute (i.e. 0 .. BULLETS_PER_PLAYER-1)
		- TODO: make it so bullet commands only accepted if they apply to the player they came from

	TODO: detect, prevent and "discourage" hacking
	
	TODO: filter out zalgo text (people spam it to lag the game)



# SERVER

	TODO: Figure out what Drain means in uWebSockets ... seemed fairly important

	MAYBE: add nginx, http/3 ? I wonder how much difference that makes

	MAYBE: ? Add WebTransport ? I don't think Bun supports it yet and supporting both transport types in a single server might be tricky.



# MOBILE

	Touch controls ? virtual joy

	fix chat on mobile



# GAMEPLAY

	Random spawn pos

	despawn bullets that hit other players ? ( ideally move collision to server, but might take longer )

	prevent player out of bouns

	health bar, regen, healing?

	DONE: Fix aiming precision


# FEATURES

	right click shotgun?


# UX / UI 

	AUDIO: TOO LOUD: web audio: sounds get queued and play on first interaction

	AUDIO: TOO LOUD: prevent "player joined" sound spam on load

	

	TODO: CHAT: make chat scroll backwards
		- obsoletes: TODO: autoscroll chat

	CHAT: make chat appear over players

	CHAT: limit chat buffer size


	DONE: preventddefault arrowkeys

	TODO: better to just remove scrollbar instead ?

	TODO: preventdefault canvas click (but this breaks defocusing chat input...)

	TODO: "I can't even tell what my player number is" (add a "YOU JOINED (Player 02)" ?)



# MISC

	TODO: favicon

	TODO: ghost players? (scrapers?)


	TODO: make player stand out? white?

	TODO: map, walls, line of sight

	TODO: variety?
		- TODO: ? weapon pickups ?

	TODO: do not randomize other player color on respawn

	TODO: better integrate chat into game ui



	DONE: Make it so chat doesn't move player






	MAYBE: a better protocol could greatly speed up loading


	DONE: Run server on port 80 (see server index.ts for instructions)

	DONE: Fix load times. (Try wasm-strip and wasm-opt, then gzip) // Note: WASM now unused

	DONE: Set up a systemd service
